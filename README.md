# Commission Templates  
## Usage
> ⚠️ These templates must not be recognizable as a copy and paste! 
Although the code is not super important to edit, things like embeds, colors, images, etc. should all be changed or edited in a way that it isn't recognizable between bots.  

Templates are an extremely useful tool for commissions as they save us Devs from remaking everything from scratch **every single time**. Thats why we decided to make a massive library of common commands, events, and interactions that can be used for commissions. Hopefully at some point, we won't have to make much from scratch at all.  

## Creating a Template  
> ⚠️ Templates should be cross compatible!
If you upload a template, it should be able to be easily combined with another template. If you upload a command, it should work with the command handler template, if you upload an embed with buttons, it should work with the button handler.  

When creating a template, make sure to checkout what's already there. Try not upload duplicates, or even extremely similar templates. Sometimes though, there may be a case where its necessary. Sometimes though, this is unavoidable with complex things such as an economy system. If you are doing a commission and can't find a template, think about making one!  

It is also super important to make comments, or annoations, of what your template does. Try to imagine your template as someone who's never seen the system before. Find your complex or confusing parts and explain what they do. All files should have at least some description of what they do (if its not extremely ovbious or there isn't a description provided such as in a command file)  

## Uploading  
> ⚠️ When uploading to the repo, always make sure you're in a seperate branch for that template!  
You should never be pushing to the main, or making edits to someones branch without permission  

#### Push Notes  
When making a new commit, always try to use the formatting below, that way if someone (including you) views your commit history, they can easily see what it's doing.  
\- for removed  
\+ for added  
% for changed  
\# for updated  
*example: ```+balance, #shop``` means you uploaded the balance command and updated the shop command.*  

#### Done with your template?  
As said above, all of your work should be inside its own branch. That makes it easy to finalize your work. Simply make a pull request and it will be reviewed for a merge. Make sure to include a detailed explanation of not only what the template is, but everything it includes.
